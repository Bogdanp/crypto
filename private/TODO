To Do
=====

- devise factory/discovery method for getting impls
- update tests
- update docs

- add Racket impls (HMAC, if nothing else)
- add support for gnutls, etc (?)

- fix balance of code between operations and impls
  current interfaces are designed around openssl/libcrypto; 
  cmd-ssl impl already exposes some problems

- figure out what to do with leftover pieces (eg DH libcrypto code)
