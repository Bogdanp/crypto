To Do
=====

- better way to request digests/ciphers/etc
- add error checking and reporting code to libgcrypt impls
- devise factory/discovery method for getting impls
- update tests
- update docs
- offer multiple padding options?

- add more Racket impls
- add support for gnutls, etc (?)

- fix balance of code between operations and impls
  current interfaces are designed around openssl/libcrypto; 
  cmd-ssl impl already exposes some problems

- figure out what to do with leftover pieces (eg DH libcrypto code)
