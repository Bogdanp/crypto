To Do
=====

- doc: how to get impls from specs
- nettle factory
- new API for sign/verify

- sections for Password Hashing
  - pbkdf2
    - libcrypto, gcrypt (gcry_kdf_derive)
  - bcrypt, scrypt (from elsewhere)

- ciphers: track bytes encrypted, better space checking

- add error checking and reporting code to libgcrypt impls
- update tests
- update docs
- offer multiple padding options?

- add more Racket impls
- add support for gnutls, etc (?)

- fix balance of code between operations and impls
  current interfaces are designed around openssl/libcrypto; 
  cmd-ssl impl already exposes some problems

- figure out what to do with leftover pieces (eg DH libcrypto code)
